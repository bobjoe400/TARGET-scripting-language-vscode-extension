# Development

Building, testing and regenerating the data tables.

*Part of the [T.A.R.G.E.T. Script](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bobjoe400.tm-target-script) VS Code extension. Back to the [README](../README.md).*

```bash
npm install
npm run gen      # regenerate builtin tables and the grammar from your TARGET install
npm run compile
npm test
```

Press <kbd>F5</kbd> to launch an Extension Development Host on `test/fixtures`.

The test suite runs the grammar through `vscode-textmate` — the same engine VS Code
uses — and checks both directions: that broken code produces the expected diagnostic,
and that a corpus of known-good real-world scripts produces **none**.
